  summary: Get all request types
  description: >-
    This method returns all customer request types used in the Jira Service
    Management instance, optionally filtered by a query string.


    Use
    [servicedeskapi/servicedesk/\{serviceDeskId\}/requesttype](#api-servicedesk-serviceDeskId-requesttype-get)
    to find the customer request types supported by a specific service desk.


    The returned list of customer request types can be filtered using the
    `query` parameter. The parameter is matched against the customer request
    types' `name` or `description`. For example, searching for "Install",
    "Inst", "Equi", or "Equipment" will match a customer request type with the
    *name* "Equipment Installation Request".

        service desks 1 and 2.
